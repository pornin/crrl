//! X448 key-exchange algorithm.
//!
//! This module implements the X448 primitive, as defined by [RFC 7748].
//! The primitive takes as input two 56-byte values, the first
//! being the representation of a point on Curve448 (a Montgomery
//! curve) or on the quadratic twist of Curve448, and the second being
//! a scalar (a big integer). The scalar is internally "clamped" (some
//! bits are set to specific values), then the point is multiplied by the
//! scalar, and the output point is reencoded into 56 bytes.
//!
//! The `x448()` function implements exactly the process described in
//! RFC 7748 (section 5). The `x448_base()` function is an optimization
//! of the specific case of the input point being the conventional
//! generator point on Curve448; `x448_base()` is fully compatible
//! with `x448()`, but also substantially faster.
//!
//! The `x448()` function does NOT filter out any value from its input;
//! any input sequence of 56 bytes is accepted, even if it encodes a
//! low-order curve point. As per RFC 7748 requirements, the top point
//! bit (most significant bit of the last byte) is ignored. As for
//! scalars, the clamping process ensures that the integer used for the
//! multiplication is a multiple of 4, at least 2^447, and lower than
//! 2^448; the two least significant bits of the first byte, and the
//! most significant bit of the last byte, are ignored.
//!
//! [RFC 7748]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7748

// Projective/fractional coordinates traditionally use uppercase letters,
// using lowercase only for affine coordinates.
